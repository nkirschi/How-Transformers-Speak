6," With effect from 27 June 2002 , Pedra Branca was declared a protected area within the meaning of the Protected Areas and Protected Places Act . Consequently , a permit from the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore is required for access to the island , and unauthorised presence there is a criminal offence . On 6 October 2008 , a Singaporean man , Roger Lee , was convicted of illegally landing on Pedra Branca . In court documents , he said he had gone to Batam , Indonesia , in 1998 . He later married and started a family with an Indonesian woman , but she left him in 2007 due to his unstable income and inability to hold down a job . As he had illegally overstayed in Indonesia , and had been cheated of his passport and other personal documents by a friend , Lee hatched a plan to pretend to be a lost fisherman in the hope that the Police Coast Guard would rescue him and take him back to Singapore . On 5 February 2008 he paid a boatman to transport him out to sea in a motorised sampan . As he did not see any coast guard or navy patrols he disembarked on Pedra Branca and was arrested by staff stationed there . Lee pleaded guilty to illegally entering Singapore via an unauthorised landing place . A second charge of being found in a protected place without permission was taken into consideration for sentencing purposes . In mitigation , Lee 's pro bono lawyer said that there was no sign on Pedra Branca warning against trespassing on the island . Lee was sentenced to six weeks ' imprisonment .
