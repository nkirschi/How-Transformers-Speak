0,"For Keloglan Kara Prens'e Karsi, I thought that, this movie is the worst movie ever made and in my whole life, I won't be able to see another one this bad. But now I understand, I was totally wrong. ""Dunyayi Kurtaran Adamin Oglu"" is much more successful in being a bad movie than Keloglan Kara Prens'e Karsi. Now I think, as long as the Turkish film producers continue to make movies, I'll continue to see unbelievably bad movies. The money, which I gave for this film was not much, but I feel sorry for my 2 hours spent for nothing. Yes, this movie is nothing. Please take my recommendation: Even if someone gives you money to watch this movie, don't even think about it. I can tell you numerous reasons about why I like a movie. But for this one, there's simply nothing to say. It was supposed to be a comedy film, but I didn't even smile!! Come on guys, is the script writer an 8 year old boy or what? What were you thinking? The original cult film ""The man who saves the world"" was also a bad movie but at least it was funny, not boring. There were scenes, which one wants to see. But for this, there's nothing to say. I assume that, this film is a bad joke for Turkish people.","([CLS])(for)(ke)(##log)(##lan)(kara)(pre)(##ns)(')(e)(ka)(##rs)(##i)(,)(i)(thought)(that)(,)(this)(movie)(is)(the)(worst)(movie)(ever)(made)(and)(in)(my)(whole)(life)(,)(i)(won)(')(t)(be)(able)(to)(see)(another)(one)(this)(bad)(.)(but)(now)(i)(understand)(,)(i)(was)(totally)(wrong)(.)("")(dun)(##ya)(##yi)(kurt)(##aran)(adam)(##in)(og)(##lu)("")(is)(much)(more)(successful)(in)(being)(a)(bad)(movie)(than)(ke)(##log)(##lan)(kara)(pre)(##ns)(')(e)(ka)(##rs)(##i)(.)(now)(i)(think)(,)(as)(long)(as)(the)(turkish)(film)(producers)(continue)(to)(make)(movies)(,)(i)(')(ll)(continue)(to)(see)(un)(##bel)(##ie)(##va)(##bly)(bad)(movies)(.)(the)(money)(,)(which)(i)(gave)(for)(this)(film)(was)(not)(much)(,)(but)(i)(feel)(sorry)(for)(my)(2)(hours)(spent)(for)(nothing)(.)(yes)(,)(this)(movie)(is)(nothing)(.)(please)(take)(my)(recommendation)(:)(even)(if)(someone)(gives)(you)(money)(to)(watch)(this)(movie)(,)(don)(')(t)(even)(think)(about)(it)(.)(i)(can)(tell)(you)(numerous)(reasons)(about)(why)(i)(like)(a)(movie)(.)(but)(for)(this)(one)(,)(there)(')(s)(simply)(nothing)(to)(say)(.)(it)(was)(supposed)(to)(be)(a)(comedy)(film)(,)(but)(i)(didn)(')(t)(even)(smile)(!)(!)(come)(on)(guys)(,)(is)(the)(script)(writer)(an)(8)(year)(old)(boy)(or)(what)(?)(what)(were)(you)(thinking)(?)(the)(original)(cult)(film)("")(the)(man)(who)(saves)(the)(world)("")(was)(also)(a)(bad)(movie)(but)(at)(least)(it)(was)(funny)(,)(not)(boring)(.)(there)(were)(scenes)(,)(which)(one)(wants)(to)(see)(.)(but)(for)(this)(,)(there)(')(s)(nothing)(to)(say)(.)(i)(assume)(that)(,)(this)(film)(is)(a)(bad)(joke)(for)(turkish)(people)(.)([SEP])",302
1,"This film has the POTENTIAL to be as great as the other two. It has pretty good characters, a pretty intriguing mystery, with this whole ""past coming back to haunt"" thread. BUT the ending is devastatingly lame.<br /><br />I watched the ""making of"", and the director seems a few bricks short of a wall. She explains the film, and why it is such a brilliant, clever film. But the gaping hole in her logic is that she is WRONG.

2,"The lead female's (Alice) son had at some point in the past been horribly murdered whilst on the way home. Alice's family blamed her for the entire tragedy and Alice had gone mad with guilt because she blamed herself.<br /><br />As she couldn't believe anyone could such a horrible crime to a child she invented an inhuman monster (a clown) as the perpetrator. Most of the film is a strange fantasy as I think she's never supposed to leave the mental institution where she's locked up. Also Darren Day wanders around symbolising Alice's alter ego, A strong version of herself who can do what she could not and fight off the monster that murdered her son.<br /><br />This may or may not be the plot of the film, to be quite honest within 5 minutes of the film starting you will desperately want to turn it off. I guarantee you will not care one bit.<br /><br />This is an art horror film with very little script and it's clear the actors are struggling with the few awful lines they do have. The film instead relies on symbolism to push the story forward. This doesn't work at all and leaves the audience very very confused. The film itself has all the hallmarks of a film that has been heavily altered and scenes/characters removed, I cannot believe that anyone would fund a 90 minute film on 10 pages of dire dialogue. I also refuse to believe anyone would knowingly make anything so bad.<br /><br />The only good point about the entire thing is that the lead actress is quite attractive.

3,"In Running Wild we see Gregory Harrison as Matt Robinson, a retired major and widower trying to bond with his kids so he thinks it would be nice to take them to Africa where poachers are killing elephants. His 14 year old daughter Angela acts like a snob, but she just happens to be hiding her real feelings after losing her mother and her little brother Nicky is just your average annoying little brother. Matt meets Rachel (lori Hallier) who works at the orphanage for animals and he takes a liking to her whilst Angela gets saved by an Englishman named Walton and she gets a crush on him, but the question remains is WHY she falls for him! All of a sudden they find a wounded baby elephant and Angela bonds with it naming it Dandy, but there are still poachers around hunting for elephants. I only got this movie because I am a fan of Greg, but I must admit the kids casting was terrible except from Munyaradzi Kanaventi (mouthful!) who plays Isaac the son of the ranger who works with Matt. There was no romance in this movie so you can really say, ""Oh so that's how they fell in love!"" They go to see Walton and yet there is NO romance! Okay so it wasn't a love story, but if it was it would've have been worth watching. It's just a bunch of people walking around in Africa or flying in a helicopter. There are 2-3 action scenes, the last one was okay, but the others lasted a few seconds. Recommended only if you're a BIG fan of one of the actors in this movie.","([CLS])(in)(running)(wild)(we)(see)(gregory)(harrison)(as)(matt)(robinson)(,)(a)(retired)(major)(and)(widow)(##er)(trying)(to)(bond)(with)(his)(kids)(so)(he)(thinks)(it)(would)(be)(nice)(to)(take)(them)(to)(africa)(where)(po)(##ache)(##rs)(are)(killing)(elephants)(.)(his)(14)(year)(old)(daughter)(angela)(acts)(like)(a)(s)(##nob)(,)(but)(she)(just)(happens)(to)(be)(hiding)(her)(real)(feelings)(after)(losing)(her)(mother)(and)(her)(little)(brother)(nicky)(is)(just)(your)(average)(annoying)(little)(brother)(.)(matt)(meets)(rachel)(()(lori)(hall)(##ier)())(who)(works)(at)(the)(orphanage)(for)(animals)(and)(he)(takes)(a)(liking)(to)(her)(whilst)(angela)(gets)(saved)(by)(an)(englishman)(named)(walton)(and)(she)(gets)(a)(crush)(on)(him)(,)(but)(the)(question)(remains)(is)(why)(she)(falls)(for)(him)(!)(all)(of)(a)(sudden)(they)(find)(a)(wounded)(baby)(elephant)(and)(angela)(bonds)(with)(it)(naming)(it)(dan)(##dy)(,)(but)(there)(are)(still)(po)(##ache)(##rs)(around)(hunting)(for)(elephants)(.)(i)(only)(got)(this)(movie)(because)(i)(am)(a)(fan)(of)(greg)(,)(but)(i)(must)(admit)(the)(kids)(casting)(was)(terrible)(except)(from)(mu)(##nya)(##rad)(##zi)(kan)(##ave)(##nti)(()(mouthful)(!)())(who)(plays)(isaac)(the)(son)(of)(the)(ranger)(who)(works)(with)(matt)(.)(there)(was)(no)(romance)(in)(this)(movie)(so)(you)(can)(really)(say)(,)("")(oh)(so)(that)(')(s)(how)(they)(fell)(in)(love)(!)("")(they)(go)(to)(see)(walton)(and)(yet)(there)(is)(no)(romance)(!)(okay)(so)(it)(wasn)(')(t)(a)(love)(story)(,)(but)(if)(it)(was)(it)(would)(')(ve)(have)(been)(worth)(watching)(.)(it)(')(s)(just)(a)(bunch)(of)(people)(walking)(around)(in)(africa)(or)(flying)(in)(a)(helicopter)(.)(there)(are)(2)(-)(3)(action)(scenes)(,)(the)(last)(one)(was)(okay)(,)(but)(the)(others)(lasted)(a)(few)(seconds)(.)(recommended)(only)(if)(you)(')(re)(a)(big)(fan)(of)(one)(of)(the)(actors)(in)(this)(movie)(.)([SEP])",333

5,"I have seen many movies in my time, many good, many bad. About 2 years ago my friends and I began watching films that could fall under the ""so bad it's good"" category, an often amusing, but none the less hit and miss approach to entertainment. After much thought I have concluded that 'Nukie' is in a class entirely of its own.<br /><br />'Nukie' is in ways astonishing, in that it seems to melt the brain of those that watch it into a messy syrup. What makes Nukie so brutally awful is hard to pinpoint, but the main issues seem to be in the characters, and the overall pace of the movie. The characters are nauseating to say the least, with the tortured, draining whimpers of aliens' Nukie and Miko becoming a motif throughout the course of the film. The Nukie costume is an assault on the senses, with a vulgar 'groin bump' and Hitler snot too, the 'hero' is not the cute extra-terrestrial the videos box promises at all. The plot is non existent, and whenever the story seems to be getting somewhere something horrific happens that seems to shoot down all the progress that damn alien has made (if any). Whats more, 'Nukie' has the bizarre quality of slowing down time, making this the most agonizing 95 minutes of you life.<br /><br />I bought a 'Nukie' video for $2 and was hoping for a movie to tear to pieces with my friends. We lasted about 20 minutes before it got us.

6,"Okay, I'll admit it--I am a goof-ball and I occasionally love a really silly comedy. While I have seen more films by Kurosawa, Bergman and Truffaut than practically anyone on the planet, I still have a soft spot for a dopey comedy that doesn't try to be sophisticated but is simply funny. A few such films that immediately come to mind are MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL, UHF, START THE REVOLUTION WITHOUT ME, STRANGE BREW and the Bill and Ted movies. They all lack snob appeal but only a zombie or professional film critic could dislike them.<br /><br />While BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY isn't as wonderful as the original Bill and Ted film, it still is great fun. Also, unlike the original, it actually seems to improve with repeated viewing. I remember not loving the film the first time I saw it--possibly because the other movie set such a high standard for laughs. But, every time I see it again I am amazed at all the great moments--particularly those involving the Grim Reaper. And, by the way, this reaper is about as different from Bergman's in THE SEVENTH SEAL as you can get!! In addition to a lot of laughs, this film features some excellent music--one way that it's actually better than the first film. The Kiss anthem at the end is great but so are the rest of the hard rock tunes--provided you aren't an old killjoy like De Nomolos.

8,"Director Frank Perry, who in the early 1970s showed some honest talent and an abundance of visual wit, channels the same cartoony approach to 'life' here as he did with his ""Compromising Positions""...and the affects are equally as meager. Shelley Long dies but comes back, however there's nothing relatably human about Long's approach to acting. Yes, she's playing a klutzy ditz with a heart of gold, but Long has no shadings, and when she tries for sincerity it rings hollow (even her overly-clear speaking voice sounds as if it's coming from an echo chamber and not a person). I liked Long in the underrated ""Irreconcilable Differences"", where she really had a chance to carve out a character beyond her snippy ""Cheers"" persona.
