0," Typically diurnal , the jungle cat hunts throughout the day . Solitary in nature , jungle cats do not interact appreciably except in the mating season . The only prominent interaction is the mother @-@ kitten bond . Territories are maintained by urine spraying and scent marking . The cat is primarily a carnivore , and prefers small mammals ( gerbils , hares and rodents ) and birds . It hunts by stalking its prey , followed by a sprint or a leap ; the sharp ears help in pinpointing the location of prey . Both sexes become sexually mature by the time they are a year old ; females enter oestrus from January to March . Mating behaviour is similar to that in the domestic cat ; the male pursues the female in oestrus , seizes her by the nape of her neck and mounts her . Gestation lasts nearly two months . Births take place between December and June , though this might vary geographically . Kittens begin to catch their own prey at around six months and leave the mother after eight or nine months .

She 's working silly jobs and she 's not in a very good place at all in any aspect of her life . Oh , and she 's in prison on suspicion of murder ... "" When asked during another interview with Digital Spy about how the character is coping with being in prison , Lister stated : "" Not very well ! It 's all completely overwhelming for her .

5," Because Guianan cocks @-@ of @-@ the @-@ rock form large leks , averaging 55 adult males , the males in these display leks were especially vulnerable to attacks and predation by large snakes and other natural predators . In manipulated groups of smaller size , around 6 , predation was less likely to occur , giving rise to an inverse relationship between the number and frequency of attacks and the size of leks . Thus , with a smaller frequency of attacks on the smaller group , the Guianan cock @-@ of @-@ the @-@ rock males was less likely to spook or disperse completely as compared to a large group where a false alarm could trigger a complete flush out 90 % of the time .

Nike in the Igbo language means "" with strength or power . "" It was through slave raiding that the Nike people acquired most of their lands , which were mostly unsettled . The Nike used slaves for a defence strategy , placing slave camps at the edge of their territories so that it was harder for an enemy to access the free born . The Nike people were allied to the Aro people who formed the Aro Confederacy ( 1690 — 1901 ) which was an Igbo organisation that controlled slave trading in the Enugu area . Along with the Aro people who came to trade from Arochukwu in the south were the Hausa people who came to trade from the north .
