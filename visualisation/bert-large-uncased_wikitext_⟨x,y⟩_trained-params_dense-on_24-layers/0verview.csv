2," The impression of a life lived without consequence , or what art historian Hans Belting describes as "" unspoilt and pre @-@ moral existence "" , is underscored by the absence of children and old people . According to the second and third chapters of Genesis , Adam and Eve 's children were born after they were expelled from Eden . This has led some commentators , in particular Belting , to theorise that the panel represents the world if the two had not been driven out "" among the thorns and thistles of the world "" . In Fraenger 's view , the scene illustrates "" a utopia , a garden of divine delight before the Fall , or — since Bosch could not deny the existence of the dogma of original sin — a millennial condition that would arise if , after expiation of Original Sin , humanity were permitted to return to Paradise and to a state of tranquil harmony embracing all Creation .

6," In 1227 , a synod of Epirote bishops in Arta tried to find a compromise , acknowledging the overall authority of the Patriarch at Nicaea but requesting administrative autonomy , i.e. the right for Theodore to appoint bishops in his domains . They gave the Patriarch three months to reply , and suggested that if he did not heed their proposals , they might be forced to recognize the supremacy of the Pope instead . Germanus replied by having the patriarchal synod condemn Theodore 's assumption of the imperial title . The conflict escalated when Germanus appointed his own candidate to the vacant see of Dyrrhachium . Theodore expelled the bishop , and the Epirote synod instead elected a friend of Chomatianos , Constantine <unk> , as the bishop . Germanus now attacked Theodore directly . In response , George Bardanes composed a letter to Germanus , which insisted on Epirote ecclesiastical autonomy and challenged the very legality of Germanus ' claims to the patriarchate . The result was a full schism between the Nicaean and Epirote churches that lasted until 1232 / 3 .

8," While scriptures related to Khandoba do not mention Banai , she is a central subject of folk songs . Banai is considered as a Dhangar , a sheep herding caste , and is sometimes regarded to be of celestial origin . Oral traditions chiefly discuss the tale of her marriage to Khandoba and her conflicts with his first wife Mhalsa . Banai is an antithesis of Mhalsa ; together they complete the god .

9," In 1975 , Oui magazine gave Keating the top spot on its "" Enemies of pornography "" list . Hamilton County prosecutor Simon L. Leis , Jr. put Ohio pornographer Larry Flynt on trial in 1976 for pandering obscenity and for engaging in a form of organized crime . Local public opinion ran against Flynt . Flynt was convicted on both counts and received the maximum sentence of 7 to 25 years in prison . While the conviction was later overturned on appeal , the verdict again established Cincinnati 's community standards in this regard , and even after Keating left for Arizona , his influence remained in Cincinnati being a center of anti @-@ pornography fervor . In the 1996 biopic , The People vs. Larry Flynt , which reportedly exaggerated Keating 's role in the prosecution and trial , Keating was portrayed by actor James Cromwell . Attempts to show Vixen ! in Cincinnati would continue , but by the late 1990s it was still illegal to do so .
