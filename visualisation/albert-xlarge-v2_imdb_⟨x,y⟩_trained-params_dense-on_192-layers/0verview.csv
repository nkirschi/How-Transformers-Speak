0,"Reading the other comments here at the IMDB, I had very high expectations before seeing 'Angels of the universe'. I wasn't disappointed, and giving the movie an 8, I would say that I can justify that grade.<br /><br />The movie has some incredible acting, especially by the main-person, Pall. The supporting actors are also doing a very good job like the patients in the mental institution, the parents and the siblings of Pall. The music is also worth mentioning, supporting the movie throughout, giving depth and feeling.<br /><br />Although the movie is very scandinavian, it doesn't leave out some humour and has a sort of objective authorship about Pall's life. Still, if you want to see a cheesy comedy or something light-weight, this is not for you. It is a story about people with mental problems, about the way they are being dealt with in society - but most of all, a story about Pall.<br /><br />I recommend this movie to all movie connoisseurs. It is one of the best movies that has ever come out of Iceland, if not out of Scandinavia.","([CLS])(reading)(the)(other)(comments)(here)(at)(the)(im)(db)(,)(i)(had)(very)(high)(expectations)(before)(seeing)()(')(angel)(s)(of)(the)(universe)(')(.)(i)(wasn)(')(t)(disappointed)(,)(and)(giving)(the)(movie)(an)(8)(,)(i)(would)(say)(that)(i)(can)(justify)(that)(grade)(.)(<unk>)(br)()(/)(<unk>)(br)()(/)(<unk>)(the)(movie)(has)(some)(incredible)(acting)(,)(especially)(by)(the)(main)(-)(person)(,)(pall)(.)(the)(supporting)(actors)(are)(also)(doing)(a)(very)(good)(job)(like)(the)(patients)(in)(the)(mental)(institution)(,)(the)(parents)(and)(the)(siblings)(of)(pall)(.)(the)(music)(is)(also)(worth)(mentioning)(,)(supporting)(the)(movie)(throughout)(,)(giving)(depth)(and)(feeling)(.)(<unk>)(br)()(/)(<unk>)(br)()(/)(<unk>)(although)(the)(movie)(is)(very)(scandinavian)(,)(it)(doesn)(')(t)(leave)(out)(some)(humour)(and)(has)(a)(sort)(of)(objective)(authorship)(about)(pall)(')(s)(life)(.)(still)(,)(if)(you)(want)(to)(see)(a)()(chee)(sy)(comedy)(or)(something)(light)(-)(weight)(,)(this)(is)(not)(for)(you)(.)(it)(is)(a)(story)(about)(people)(with)(mental)(problems)(,)(about)(the)(way)(they)(are)(being)(dealt)(with)(in)(society)()(-)(but)(most)(of)(all)(,)(a)(story)(about)(pall)(.)(<unk>)(br)()(/)(<unk>)(br)()(/)(<unk>)(i)(recommend)(this)(movie)(to)(all)(movie)(con)(no)(isse)(urs)(.)(it)(is)(one)(of)(the)(best)(movies)(that)(has)(ever)(come)(out)(of)(iceland)(,)(if)(not)(out)(of)(scandinavia)(.)([SEP])",254
1,"If ""Love Me Tonight"" is ""the musical for people who don't like musicals"", it has to be said that ""The Gay Desperado"" is definitely not a musical for people who don't like opera. In fact -- despite apparently being based on a comic operetta -- it is not really a musical at all but a spoof bandit story with interpolated unrelated arias to show off the voice of one character; and what a voice it is.<br /><br />Nino Martini, as the young singer Chivo who joins the bandit troop to get a spot on the radio (no, the plot doesn't make a lot more sense later on either...), has a glorious golden tenor whose style hasn't dated a day since the era when it was recorded. The trillings and warblings of some of his musical contemporaries belong to a bygone fashion, but it's very easy to picture Chivo belting out ""Nessun Dorma"" to a World Cup crowd and topping the charts in the process. Unfortunately, while he has an engaging grin and a decent dramatic range, he is completely incapable of acting and singing at the same time. The result is that the otherwise rapid-paced film grinds to a shuddering halt every time Chivo lays his hand on his breast and starts to declaim, and the viewer's tolerance of the result is likely to depend on his appreciation of operatic performance.<br /><br />Aside from this drawback, the film is an enjoyable broad-brush satire on Hollywood conventions and the Mexican bandit stereotype in particular, which achieves the vital goal of all such spoofs in making its characters engaging enough in their own right to hold the viewer's interest when the joke would otherwise have grown stale. The bandit chief and his sidekick have the traditional double-act relationship, there is an enigmatic peon with a carved-teak face, and a spirited heroine (a young Ida Lupino) who performs the generic ""you say you hate me but you love me really"" routine with a refreshing twist.<br /><br />Overall the film is entertaining and pretty funny, and I feel I did get my money's-worth -- but it can't be denied that the musical interludes, while admirable in their own way, introduce severe pacing problems.","([CLS])(if)()("")(love)(me)(tonight)("")(is)()("")(the)(musical)(for)(people)(who)(don)(')(t)(like)(musical)(s)("")(,)(it)(has)(to)(be)(said)(that)()("")(the)(gay)(des)(per)(ado)("")(is)(definitely)(not)(a)(musical)(for)(people)(who)(don)(')(t)(like)(opera)(.)(in)(fact)()(-)(-)(despite)(apparently)(being)(based)(on)(a)(comic)(operetta)()(-)(-)(it)(is)(not)(really)(a)(musical)(at)(all)(but)(a)(spoof)(band)(it)(story)(with)(interpol)(ated)(unrelated)(aria)(s)(to)(show)(off)(the)(voice)(of)(one)(character)(;)(and)(what)(a)(voice)(it)(is)(.)(<unk>)(br)()(/)(<unk>)(br)()(/)(<unk>)(ni)(no)(martin)(i)(,)(as)(the)(young)(singer)(chi)(vo)(who)(joins)(the)(band)(it)(troop)(to)(get)(a)(spot)(on)(the)(radio)()(()(no)(,)(the)(plot)(doesn)(')(t)(make)(a)(lot)(more)(sense)(later)(on)(either)(.)(.)(.)())(,)(has)(a)(glorious)(golden)(tenor)(whose)(style)(hasn)(')(t)(dated)(a)(day)(since)(the)(era)(when)(it)(was)(recorded)(.)(the)(trill)(ing)(s)(and)(war)(bling)(s)(of)(some)(of)(his)(musical)(contemporaries)(belong)(to)(a)(by)(gone)(fashion)(,)(but)(it)(')(s)(very)(easy)(to)(picture)(chi)(vo)(belt)(ing)(out)()("")(ness)(un)(dorm)(a)("")(to)(a)(world)(cup)(crowd)(and)(to)(pping)(the)(charts)(in)(the)(process)(.)(unfortunately)(,)(while)(he)(has)(an)(engaging)(grin)(and)(a)(decent)(dramatic)(range)(,)(he)(is)(completely)(incapable)(of)(acting)(and)(singing)(at)(the)(same)(time)(.)(the)(result)(is)(that)(the)(otherwise)(rapid)(-)(paced)(film)(grind)(s)(to)(a)(shuddering)(halt)(every)(time)(chi)(vo)(lay)(s)(his)(hand)(on)(his)(breast)(and)(starts)(to)(de)(claim)(,)(and)(the)(viewer)(')(s)(tolerance)(of)(the)(result)(is)(likely)(to)(depend)(on)(his)(appreciation)(of)(operatic)(performance)(.)(<unk>)(br)()(/)(<unk>)(br)()(/)(<unk>)(a)(side)(from)(this)(draw)(back)(,)(the)(film)(is)(an)(enjoyable)(broad)(-)(brush)(satire)(on)(hollywood)(conventions)(and)(the)(mexican)(band)(it)(stereotype)(in)(particular)(,)(which)(achieve)(s)(the)(vital)(goal)(of)(all)(such)(spoof)(s)(in)(making)(its)(characters)(engaging)(enough)(in)(their)(own)(right)(to)(hold)(the)(viewer)(')(s)(interest)(when)(the)(joke)(would)(otherwise)(have)(grown)()(s)(tale)(.)(the)(band)(it)(chief)(and)(his)(sidekick)(have)(the)(traditional)(double)(-)(act)(relationship)(,)(there)(is)(an)(enigmatic)(pe)(on)(with)(a)(carved)(-)(te)(ak)(face)(,)(and)(a)()(spirited)(heroine)()(()(a)(young)()(ida)(lupin)(o)())(who)(performs)(the)(generic)()("")(you)(say)(you)(hate)(me)(but)(you)(love)(me)(really)("")(routine)(with)(a)(refreshing)(twist)(.)(<unk>)(br)()(/)(<unk>)(br)()(/)(<unk>)(over)(all)(the)(film)(is)(entertaining)(and)(pretty)(funny)(,)(and)(i)(feel)(i)(did)(get)(my)(money)(')(s)(-)(worth)()(-)(-)(but)(it)(can)(')(t)(be)(denied)(that)(the)(musical)(inter)(lude)(s)(,)(while)(a)(d)(mir)(able)(in)([SEP])",512

3,"Whatever rating I give BOOM is only because of the superb location photography of Sardinia and Rome. Otherwise, this is only for hardcore addicts of ELIZABETH TAYLOR (her downward phase), and RICHARD BURTON (his miscasting phase). Tennessee Williams wrote ""The Milk Train Doesn't Stop Here Anymore"" and is supposed to be very fond of this adaptation of his play--but apparently, he was the only one. Taylor reportedly hated it and Burton needed the money.<br /><br />Whatever, it amounts to a hill of beans with Taylor posturing and fuming in her shrill manner, exploding at the servants and exchanging bad baby-talk with no less than NOEL COWARD who seems to be a visitor from another film when he finally appears.<br /><br />It's so campy that among Taylor fans it's probably considered a ""must see"" kind of thing. But if you can sit through this one without a drink in your hand, you're way ahead of me. Sadly, this is the film that signified the end of Taylor being taken seriously as a film actress, even after winning two Oscars. For Burton, it was equally disastrous and the critics called it a BOMB.

4,"_Les Acteurs_ is the absurd story of Jean-Pierre Marielle desperately waiting for a cup of hot water, the story of a conspiracy against actors, the story of aging actors whose careers are slowly less active than they used to be, but a stunning tribute to French actors and their cinema.<br /><br />Supported by a solid reflection about cinema and acting (the fourth wall, the hidden cameras, to play or not to play), the story of this film in which most of those famous actors play their own role (not to be mixed up with living their life in front of the camera - the film is not voyeur) is quite vague, and follows the actors in series of episodes which make the film quite amusing.

Hmm,....odds are 187,000,000 to 1 but he finds her. Then, instead of either killing her or turning her over to the police, he forgives her--even when she acknowledges what she has done. Okay--this is tough to believe, but okay,...but then he helps to hide her from a private detective by murdering him!!!! No one is that stupid! Yes, the character Catherine Deneuve plays is quite beautiful but come on folks--this is just silly.

The main character suffers severe injury to his head and hand from a relative fender bender, while walking away from a car accident in which the car he is in, going at full tilt down an expressway, flips over a median and land upside down hitting another car, which then causes them both to blow up within a matter of seconds...<br /><br />yet he escapes unscathed...<br /><br />Please, don't waste your money on this film . . . go watch classic Hitchcock. . . he also did an enormous amount of research on the subject but he also knew how to tell a good story.<br /><br />Watch the zoom-in shot at the beginning from outer space to the Meditteranean, it is alright, though a bit cliché these days, then go demand your money back for those of you who have accidentally bought your tickets in advance.","([CLS])(i)(went)(to)(see)(this)(film)(with)(a)(fairly)(international)(group)(of)(film)(go)(ers)(.)()(.)()(.)(and)(we)(all)(hated)(it)(.)(apart)(from)(some)(interesting)(cinematography)()(()(eg)(.)(the)(tandem)(swim)(at)(sunset)())(this)(film)(is)(absolutely)(empty)(.)(i)(can)(')(t)(remember)(a)(film)(where)(i)(felt)(so)(cheated)(out)(of)(my)(money)(and)(my)(time)(.)(<unk>)(br)()(/)(<unk>)(br)()(/)(<unk>)(on)(the)(yahoo)(cinema)(site)(for)(the)(film)(it)(said)(that)(the)(director)(did)(an)(enormous)(amount)(of)(research)(:)(<unk>)(br)()(/)(<unk>)(br)()(/)(<unk>)("")(fred)(eric)(scho)(en)(do)(er)(ffer)()(s)(')(est)(en)(or)(m)(ement)(document)(e)(sur)(le)(me)(tier)()(d)(')(a)(gent)(secret)(en)(pro)(ced)(ant)(a)(un)(tri)(method)(ique)(des)(information)(s)(rec)(ue)(illi)(es)(a)(ce)(su)(jet)("")(.)(<unk>)(br)()(/)(<unk>)(br)()(/)(<unk>)(if)(this)(is)(true)(then)(the)(spy)(business)(has)(to)(be)(the)(most)(boring)(profession)(on)(earth)(.)(granted)(i)(realize)(it)(isn)(')(t)(all)(james)(bond)(in)(real)(life)(,)(but)(it)(has)(to)(be)(a)(thousand)(times)(more)(interesting)(than)(the)(film)(,)(because)(someone)(could)(pay)(me)(to)(be)(a)(spy)(,)(but)(they)(could)(never)(pay)(me)(enough)(to)(have)(to)(watch)(this)(film)(again)(.)(<unk>)(br)()(/)(<unk>)(br)()(/)(<unk>)(it)(should)(be)(pointed)(out)(,)(i)(think)(,)(that)(the)(director)(didn)(')(t)(do)(an)(enormous)(amount)(of)(research)(into)(car)(accidents)(.)(the)(main)(character)(suffer)(s)(severe)(injury)(to)(his)(head)(and)(hand)(from)(a)(relative)(fender)()(bender)(,)(while)(walking)(away)(from)(a)(car)(accident)(in)(which)(the)(car)(he)(is)(in)(,)(going)(at)(full)(tilt)(down)(an)(expressway)(,)(flip)(s)(over)(a)(median)(and)(land)(upside)(down)(hitting)(another)(car)(,)(which)(then)(causes)(them)(both)(to)(blow)(up)(within)(a)(matter)(of)(seconds)(.)(.)(.)(<unk>)(br)()(/)(<unk>)(br)()(/)(<unk>)(yet)(he)(escapes)(un)(s)(ca)(the)(d)(.)(.)(.)(<unk>)(br)()(/)(<unk>)(br)()(/)(<unk>)(please)(,)(don)(')(t)(waste)(your)(money)(on)(this)(film)()(.)()(.)()(.)(go)(watch)(classic)(hitchcock)(.)()(.)()(.)(he)(also)(did)(an)(enormous)(amount)(of)(research)(on)(the)(subject)(but)(he)(also)(knew)(how)(to)(tell)(a)(good)(story)(.)(<unk>)(br)()(/)(<unk>)(br)()(/)(<unk>)(watch)(the)(zoom)(-)(in)(shot)(at)(the)(beginning)(from)(outer)(space)(to)(the)()(medi)(tter)(ane)(an)(,)(it)(is)(alright)(,)(though)(a)(bit)(cliche)(these)(days)(,)(then)(go)(demand)(your)(money)(back)(for)(those)(of)(you)(who)(have)(accidentally)(bought)(your)(tickets)(in)(advance)(.)([SEP])",478
9,"i don't know why, but after all the hype on NPR i thought this was a new movie.....all the best footage has been used for BBC docs and NatGeo projects that you have seen if you are interested in nature programs...it has been repackaged with sappy narration and over-dramatic music for Disney to take advantage of Earth Day-there are great moments, and it is always nice to listen to Darth Vader.......oops,........... James Earl Jones speak, but I had hoped for a ground breaking movie , considering the new camera technology used in the making of this film......it has been sanitized for a child audience, so one can actually see better footage for free on youtube ....i feel that we are due for something as ground breaking as Koyannisquatsi (sic) and this movie is certainly not it","([CLS])(i)(don)(')(t)(know)(why)(,)(but)(after)(all)(the)(hype)(on)(npr)(i)(thought)(this)(was)(a)(new)(movie)(.)(.)(.)(.)(.)(all)(the)(best)(footage)(has)(been)(used)(for)(bbc)(doc)(s)(and)(nat)(ge)(o)(projects)(that)(you)(have)(seen)(if)(you)(are)(interested)(in)(nature)(programs)(.)(.)(.)(it)(has)(been)(re)(pack)(aged)(with)(sa)(ppy)(narration)(and)(over)(-)(dra)(matic)(music)(for)(disney)(to)(take)(advantage)(of)(earth)(day)(-)(there)(are)(great)(moments)(,)(and)(it)(is)(always)(nice)(to)(listen)(to)(dar)(th)(va)(der)(.)(.)(.)(.)(.)(.)(.)(oop)(s)(,)(.)(.)(.)(.)(.)(.)(.)(.)(.)(.)(.)(james)(earl)(jones)(speak)(,)(but)(i)(had)(hoped)(for)(a)(ground)(breaking)(movie)()(,)(considering)(the)(new)(camera)(technology)(used)(in)(the)(making)(of)(this)(film)(.)(.)(.)(.)(.)(.)(it)(has)(been)(san)(it)(ized)(for)(a)(child)(audience)(,)(so)(one)(can)(actually)(see)(better)(footage)(for)(free)(on)(youtube)()(.)(.)(.)(.)(i)(feel)(that)(we)(are)(due)(for)(something)(as)(ground)(breaking)(as)(ko)(yan)(nis)(qua)(tsi)()(()(sic)())(and)(this)(movie)(is)(certainly)(not)(it)([SEP])",210
